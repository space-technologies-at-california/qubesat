To start STACet on mac open a terminal window at the STACet directory, and type bash start_STACet.sh

"python3 test_send.py" will send a test packet.

Everything here is very bare-bones, this will send and receive AFSK AX.25 packets, but do not much else...

Right now STACet requires another window running NetCat or similar @ localhost port 8001 (127.0.0.1:8001)
Hoping to work on a GUI for STACet.

More info will come.
